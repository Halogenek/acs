## Initializing project

With every project it's good to start with appropriate dependency separation, make sure `Python 3.8` is installed
on your machine, then proceed with commands:

> `virtualenv 'name-of-you-choice'`

> `source ./name-of-you-choice/bin/activate`

Install project dependencies:

> `pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements.dev.txt`

In your IDE configure project interpreter to created virtualenv.
